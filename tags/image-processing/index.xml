      <description>Improved vision has lots of real life applications including the cameras used in self driving cars, medical images to diagnose accurately. I am currently working on a project named &amp;quot; Vechicle Detection in Foggy/Rainy season&amp;quot; to help improve the performance of self driving cars in adverse weather. For that I used some basic image processing techniques to start with and improve the visibility of vechicle images in foggy weather. Improved vision will not only help to prevent accidents in self-driving cars but also it can be used with traffic light systems, to detect vehicles and their license numbers/color of vehicle/model with better accuracy.</description>
